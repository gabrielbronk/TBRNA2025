This folder performs logistic regression with lasso regularization. It uses transcriptomics from birth to predict whether an individual will be a progressor (symptomatic) or non-progressor (asymptomatic) if they become infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis. The scripts can also be used to predict other case vs. control categories (infected vs. non-infected, or progressor vs, everyone else).

To run the logistic regression with lasso regularization, start with “MultipleLogisticRegressionWithLasso.Rmd”, first making sure to set your desired options in "OptionsForMultipleLogisticRegression.R".

If you run “MultipleLogisticRegressionWithLasso.Rmd” using parallel jobs, you will next need to run “CombiningOutputFilesFromMultipleLogisticRegression.Rmd” to combine the outputs of the parallel jobs into a single file. If you didn’t use parallel jobs, you can skip this.

Finally, you will run “MultipleLogisticRegressionPerformanceEvaluation.Rmd”, which will tell you how well the model performed or the coefficients of the model.
